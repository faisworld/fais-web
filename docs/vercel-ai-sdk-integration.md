# Vercel AI SDK Integration Plan

This document outlines how the Vercel AI SDK will be leveraged within the O3 assistant project, particularly for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline and potentially other AI-driven features.

## Key Use Cases

1. **RAG Pipeline Query Endpoint**: The SDK will be used to build the API endpoint that takes a user query, retrieves relevant context from our knowledge base, and then uses an LLM (via the SDK) to generate an answer.
    * Handles streaming responses back to the client.
    * Simplifies interaction with the chosen LLM provider.

2. **AI Chat Interface (Future)**: If a chat interface is developed for the O3 assistant, the `useChat` hook and associated UI components from the SDK will be used.

3. **Content Generation Tools (Enhancements)**: Existing tools like article generation could potentially be refactored or enhanced to use the SDK for more robust LLM interaction.

## Core SDK Features to Utilize

* `useChat` / `useCompletion` hooks for frontend interactions.
* Backend helper functions for creating API routes that stream responses.
* Standardized API for different LLM providers.

## Implementation Notes

* The RAG query endpoint (`app/api/rag-query/route.ts` or similar) will be a primary integration point.
* Ensure environment variables for the chosen LLM provider are configured for Vercel deployment.
