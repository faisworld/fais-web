1. **Carousel Upload Page TypeScript Errors**
   - Fixed handling of `data.mediaItems` being undefined
   - Added support for both array and object API response formats
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **HomeCarousel Component**
   - Ensured exactly three slides are shown in the carousel
   - Added logic to handle different API response formats
   - Improved fallback mechanism for missing slides
   - Fixed slide ordering to match required keys

3. **Gallery API Issues**
   - Added table existence check before querying
   - Improved error handling for database operations
   - Fixed handling of different column naming conventions (alt-tag vs alt_tag)
   - Added result processing to ensure consistent property names
   - Limited results to 100 images to improve performance

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Added a new API endpoint at `/api/admin/carousel/check-data` for diagnosing carousel issues
   - Enhanced logging throughout the codebase

## Implementation Details

### Carousel Upload Page
- Modified to handle both array and object response formats from the API
- Added better error handling with specific error messages
- Created proper fallback slides with valid keys when data is missing

### HomeCarousel Component
- Added support for different API response formats
- Enhanced slide filtering to ensure exactly three required slides are shown
- Improved fallback mechanism for missing slides
- Added explicit slide ordering based on required keys

### Gallery API
- Fixed query construction to handle missing or differently named columns
- Added robust error handling for both database connection and query errors
- Ensured database connections are properly closed in all scenarios
- Standardized the API response format for consistent client-side handling

## Required Carousel Slide Keys
The system is configured to require exactly three specific carousel slides:
1. `advanced-ai-&-blockchain-solutions`
2. `shaping-state-of-the-art-technologies`
3. `driving-innovation-in-technology`

These slide keys must match exactly in order for the carousel to function properly.

## Future Maintenance Notes
- The carousel code is designed to handle both new and legacy API response formats
- Always ensure database connections are properly closed in finally blocks
- When modifying the carousel, maintain the three required slide keys
- Use the `/api/admin/carousel/check-data` endpoint for troubleshooting carousel issues
